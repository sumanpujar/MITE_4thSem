Question: 1  Student Report Card. 

Problem Statement:   Define a `nested structure` where:  - `Student` structure contains `ID`, `Name`, and `Marks` (another structure with `3 subjects`).  
- Write a program to:  
  1. Read student details for `N students`.  
  2. Compute their `total marks` and `average`.  
  3. Display details along with `grade classification` 
  (`A` for >=90%, `B` for 75-89%, etc.).  
`Function Prototypes:`  
void readStudents(Student students[], int n);
void calculateGrades(Student students[], int n);
void displayStudents(Student students[], int n);
`Sample Test Case:`  
`Input:`  
Enter number of students: 2  
Enter details (ID, Name, Marks in 3 subjects):  
1 Athmi 80 90 85  
2 Pradyun 95 98 92  
`Output:`  
Mike - Total: 255, Average: 85, Grade: B  
Pradyun - Total: 285, Average: 95, Grade: A

Question: 2

Problem Statement: Library Management System

A library system stores information about books and their availability. 
Each book has a title, author, ISBN number, and status (available or borrowed). 
You are tasked with creating a system to manage the library's collection of books 
using arrays of structures and pointers to structures.

 Book Structure: Define a structure Book that holds the following details:

Title: A string representing the book title.
Author: A string representing the author's name.
ISBN: An integer representing the book's ISBN number.
Status: A string ("Available" or "Borrowed") indicating the book's current availability.
Functionality:

Add Book: Add a new book to the library collection.
Display All Books: Display all books with their details (title, author, ISBN, status).
Borrow Book: Change the status of a book to "Borrowed" when a user borrows it.
Return Book: Change the status of a book back to "Available" when a user returns it.
Use pointers to structures to manage and manipulate the books in the library.
