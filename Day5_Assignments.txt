Question:1 Student Record Management
Problem Statement : Design a simple program that reads and writes student records to a test file and calculates the average score of students.

Requirements:
Store Student Records:

Each student has a record consisting of:
Student Name (string)
Student ID (integer)
Marks (float, representing the score out of 100)
Write the Student Records to a File:

The records should be stored in a text file )
Each record should be saved on a new line.
Format of each record should be:

Student Name, Student ID, Marks
Example:

Suresh, 101, 89.5
Ram, 102, 76.0

Read from the File:

Your program should read the records from the file.
Extract the Marks from each record and store them in a list or array.
Calculate the Average Marks:

Calculate the average score of all students based on the marks read from the file.
Display:

Display the average marks of all students.
Also, print each student's name, ID, and marks on the console for verification.

Question:2
Problem Statement:`  
Given an array of `N integers`, find the `most frequently occurring` number.  
- If multiple numbers occur with the same frequency, return the `smallest` one.  
`Function Prototype:`  
int mostFrequentElement(int arr[], int n);
`Sample Test Case:`  
`Input:`  
Enter array size: 10  
Enter elements: 3 1 3 2 1 3 4 1 1 5  
`Output:`  
Most Frequent Element: 1 (occurs 4 times)
